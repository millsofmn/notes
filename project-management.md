## Organizational Structures

### Functional 

The classical structure where staff is hierarchical organized by departments. Each of the staff reports to one supervisor up the chain until the department head report to the CEO. The work is primarly done in a siloed fashioned. 

Project Managers have little formal authority in this type of structure.

There are some advantages to this type of organization: The employees know who they are responsible to and growth protential and career paths are understood.

### Matrix 

The matrix organization are typically organized amoung department lines, like functional but resources are assigned to the project manager. Whereby the employee may have two reporting supervisors. There are three types of matrix organizations:

* **Strong Matrix**: emphasizes project work over functional duties. The project manager has majority of the power.
* **Weak Matrix**: emphasizes functional work orver project work. The functional manager has majority of the power.
* **Balanced Matrix**: there is equal emphasizes on functional and project work. Both the project and functional manager share power.

### Projectized 

The projectized organization is organized by projects rather than functional work units. The project manager have the majority of the power and the support/admin staff report to them based on their project.

| | Functional | Weak Matrix | Blanaced Matrix | Strong Matrix | Projectized |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Proj Mgr Authority | Little or None | Low | Low to Moderate | Mod to High | High to Total |
| Resource Avail. | Little or None | Low | Low to Moderate | Mod to High | High to Total |

## Benefit Measurement Model 

The benefit measurement model uses a critera to determine if the cost of doing the project outweighs not doing it. There are four common benefits measurements methods:

1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: compare the cost of the project to the financial gain of doing it.
1. **Scoring Model**: has a predefined list of criteria against which the project is rated.
1. **Payback Period**: is the cash flow technique that identifies the length of time it takes for the project to be profitable. 
1. **Economic Model**: is a series of financial calculations that or cashflow techniques which provide data on the overall financials of the project. 
    * **Discounted Cash Flow**: compares the futures value of the project's expected cash flow in today's dollars. (i.e. year 1 $400,000, year 2 $2.5 million and year 3 $3.2 million.
    * **Net Present Value**: (NVP) is the difference between the present value of cash inflow and the present value of cash outflow over a period of time. (i.e. how much it cost to create and maintain verses how much money it will make over a period of time)
    * **Internal Rate of Return**: (IRR) is the intrest rate at which a project will make money. It is determined by the discounted rate when present value of the inflow equals the original investment. (Once the cost of the project is paid for. What is the profitablity of it? Maintence verses Income)
